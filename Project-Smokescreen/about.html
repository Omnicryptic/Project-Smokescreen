		<h1 align="center">About Project Smokescreen</h1>

		<p class="par">
    Project Smokescreen is a history simulator. Nations, containing people with hopes, dreams, and personalities, 
    are generated and simulated. At present time, the simulation is rather featureless. In fact, it probably couldn't hold
    any sane person's attention for more than a minute or two. However, it will soon house an entire simulated
    world, where all kinds of systems and mechanics interact together dynamically to create some sembelance of reality.

	Let me be clear though: This is a hobby project. I'm making no promise to finish it, and I may abandon it at any moment. However,
	assuming things keep going as smoothly as they have, I do believe it'll develop into something interesting.
