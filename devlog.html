          	So there's a pretty solid release format now. The 0.0.x versions will all be working towards simulating the world itself. 0.1.0 will be the first major update after 0.0.1, and it will allow for full control over a human in the world, effectively making this project a "game".
		<br>
		<br>
          	As you may have noticed, I just released version 0.0.1. It features a fully functional (albeit a little ugly and messy) GUI. I've gotten through enough bugfixing and work on the backbone that I think it's about time to add some cool features.
          	<br>

          	I'll soon be giving humans emotions. I want them to feel pain. And love. But mostly pain, since that's easiest to simulate. On top of that, I'm giving humans relationships, which will just be a construct that contains an "Emotion" object, a title, such as "Friend", "Father", 
		or "Annoyance", and an ID to allow the program to find the person that the relationship refers to. The Emotion object will contain all of the needed information about an emotional state, from how someone feels about someone else, to their general mood, to how a nation feels 
		about it's Monarch (hehehe).
