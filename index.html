	<par class="par"> Here is the central point of all things Omnicryptic, the pseudonym under which I publish all of my not-so-various hobby
	projects. Currently, my interests are drifting around the area of simulations and games, and this interest manifests itself
	in the form of <strong>Project Smokescreen</strong>, a world simulation inspired by <a class="inlink" href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves">Dwarf Fortress</a>
	, the brainchild of Tarn and Zach Adams, although nowhere near as vast in terms of scope and complexity; especially now, in the beginning. More
	information about this project can be found below.

		Bugs are to be expected, since I can't anticipate all the possible differences that my programs will encounter between computer
		systems. At present time though, I have set up no method of bug reporting, which is pretty essential to any independent project.
		However, bugs can be brought to my attention using methods listed in the <a href="follow.html" class="inlink">Follow Me</a> section, but if my projects ever
		get a notable number of followers, upgrades will need to happen.
